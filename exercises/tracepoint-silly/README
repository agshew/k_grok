Based on example from:

Using the TRACE_EVENT() macro (Part 3)
http://lwn.net/Articles/383362/

My version measures the time it takes to increment
the counter and print hello world.

As root:

insmod sillymod-event.ko

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing

echo 1 > events/silly/me_silly/enable


To add a load during the test, you
can do something like:

perf bench sched messaging -l 10000

cat trace

# tracer: nop
#
# entries-in-buffer/entries-written: 377/377   #P:2
#

#                             / _----=> need-resched
#                            | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
#                            || / _--=> preempt-depth

perl -ne '/me_silly: (\d+), (\d+)/ && print "$1, $2\n"' trace >> /tmp/silly-before.dat

apt-get install r-base r-cran-ggplot2 imagemagick

./silly-plots.R silly-before.dat

display *png

After modifying the code, removing the module, and tracing again, you can plot
both on the same graph.

./silly-plots.R silly-before.dat silly-after.dat


How to interpret CDFs and PDFs

With latencies, smaller is better, and less variation is better. So, a better
CDF should be more to the left and more vertical. Likewise, a better PDF will
be more to the left, have a higher peak, and be less spread out.

If you are having difficulty visually comparing CDFs and PDFs, try switching
the scale. If the difference between the min and max is large, then try a
logarithmic scale. Otherwise, the regular scale is probably better. You can
also try zooming in on a region of the graph that is particularly interesting
by changing the minimum and maximum values on that axis.
