Record all of your command-line work using:

asciinema rec /tmp/sqrt-username

Start screen and create multiple terminal buffers (i.e. console sessions) in
screen via '<CTRL>+a c'. Switch between them via commands such as '<CTRL>+a "'
(that the control and letter a keys pressed simultaneously, followed by a press
of the double quote key).

Email the instructors and TA the resulting asciinema file.

Review a patch

Send an email to the instructor and TA reviewing the following:

[PATCH] Optimize int_sqrt for small values for faster idle
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1063272.html

In this review, please include suggestions for improving the patch name of
person who last modified that code list of everywhere the code is used
benchmarks previous code vs. new code benchmark in a kernel module, not
userspace use perf trace events, and graph CDF and PDF, see
k_grok/exercises/tracepoint-silly/

If jiffies aren't high enough resolution, then try ktime_get(), and use macros
like ktime_sub(lhs, rhs) and ktime_to_ns(...) instead of standard math ops.

Spot-check or prove correctness.

Submit a patch

Reroll the patch you just reviewed, addressing the feedback of the kernel
developers and your review. Send the rerolled patch to the instructor and TA.
It should include the appropriate version in the subject's tag.

Optimize teh function for a new random range of numbers.

Go to https://www.random.org, change max to 1000000, and generate two random
numbers see the prandom_u32() function in the kernel for generating numbers to
test, and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2509679/how-to-generate-a-random-number-from-within-a-range
for ranges of random numbers maybe get some ideas from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100090/looking-for-an-efficient-integer-square-root-algorithm-for-arm-thumb2

Cite the source of anything you don't write patch changelog.

Benchmarks as above (the benchmark kernel module patch should be a separate
email in the series).

Remember all of the other things the documentation says a patch should have.
